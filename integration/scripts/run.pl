# tree, so it stays green through a tag that never landed, a MANIFEST that ships
# no lib/, or a prerequisite a consumer cannot resolve.
#
#   perl scripts/run.pl            # from integration/, with cpanm on PATH
#   ./scripts/run.sh               # the same thing in docker
#
# Two conditions make the run meaningless rather than failing, and each one skips
# with a reason instead:
#
#   1. Nothing published satisfies the floor in cpanfile. Before the first release
#      there is no artifact to test at all.
#   2. A tier's staging key is missing. The unauthenticated tests still run, and
#      each tier without a key skips from inside the suite, so the skip and its
#      reason land in the test output rather than in this script's preamble.
